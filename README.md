# Assignment 8 - Strongly Connected Components

Consider the directed graph `G` given by its nodes and links in files nodes.csv and links.csv, respectively.  For this assignment, you will use networkx to compute the strongly connected components of `G`, and then visualize them with Gephi.

Networkx is a Python package, so you will have to use Python for this assignment.  You can use it in Google Colab to save time with local installation.  Please submit your code in Python that reads the graph from the files and determines the strongly connected components.

You then have to pass the graph `G` and its strongly connected components from Python to Gephi, using one of the available formats. The information on strongly connected components is to be passed as node annotations, that is, for each node, indicate the component it belongs to.  The naming of components is up to you.  Please submit the file (or files) used to convey all this relevant information from Python to Gephi.

Then load the graph in Gephi, label the nodes with their names (not numbers), color the strongly connected components with different colors, export the drawing in png format, and submit it here as well.
